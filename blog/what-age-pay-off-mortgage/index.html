            <h1>What Age Should You Pay Off Your Mortgage?</h1>
            <div class="meta">6 min read</div>

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    "When should I pay off my mortgage?" is one of the most common questions homeowners ask. The answer depends on your financial situation, goals, and personal values. Let's explore how to find the right target age for you.
                </p>

                <h2>Common Payoff Age Targets</h2>
                <p>
                    Most people aim for one of these milestones:
                </p>

                <table class="comparison-table">
                    <tr>
                        <th>Target Age</th>
                        <th>Why People Choose It</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>50</strong></td>
                        <td>Maximum interest savings, aggressive wealth building, early financial freedom</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>55</strong></td>
                        <td>Balance between savings and lifestyle, often 10+ years before retirement</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>60</strong></td>
                        <td>Debt-free before traditional retirement, lower monthly commitment until then</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>65</strong></td>
                        <td>Aligned with retirement, reduces fixed expenses when income drops</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

                <h2>Factors to Consider</h2>

                <h2>1. Your Retirement Plans</h2>
                <p>
                    If you plan to retire at 65, being mortgage-free by then means your retirement income goes further. Without a mortgage payment, you need significantly less to maintain your lifestyle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many financial advisors suggest being mortgage-free at least 5 years before retirement. This gives you time to redirect former mortgage payments into retirement savings for a final boost.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Your Interest Rate</h2>
                <p>
                    The higher your interest rate, the more valuable it is to pay off early:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>7%+ interest:</strong> Strong case for aggressive payoff - you're paying a lot in interest</li>
                    <li><strong>4-6% interest:</strong> Balanced approach makes sense - consider both payoff and investing</li>
                    <li><strong>Under 4%:</strong> Less urgency - your money might work harder invested elsewhere</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. Your Other Financial Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    Consider where mortgage payoff fits among your priorities:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are you maximizing retirement contributions?</li>
                    <li>Do your kids need college funding?</li>
                    <li>Do you have other high-interest debt?</li>
                    <li>Is your emergency fund solid?</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> Address 401(k) matching, high-interest debt, and emergency funds before accelerating mortgage payoff. After that, extra mortgage payments become a great option.
                </div>

                <h2>4. The Peace of Mind Factor</h2>
                <p>
                    Don't underestimate the psychological value of being debt-free. For many people, the security and freedom of owning their home outright is worth more than potential investment returns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No spreadsheet can calculate the feeling of knowing that no matter what happens with your job or the economy, you have a roof over your head that no one can take away.
                </p>

                <h2>How to Choose Your Target Age</h2>
                <p>
                    Here's a practical approach:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Start with retirement:</strong> When do you want to retire? Aim to be mortgage-free at least by then.</li>
                    <li><strong>Work backwards:</strong> How much extra would you need to pay each month to hit that target?</li>
                    <li><strong>Reality check:</strong> Is that extra payment affordable without sacrificing other important goals?</li>
                    <li><strong>Adjust as needed:</strong> Find the balance between an aggressive goal and a sustainable payment.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Find Your Number</h2>
                <p>
                    The best way to choose your target age is to see the actual numbers. Our calculator shows you exactly how much extra you'd need to pay each month to reach any payoff age, plus how much interest you'd save.
