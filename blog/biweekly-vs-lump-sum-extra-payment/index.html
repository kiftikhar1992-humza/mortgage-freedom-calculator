            <h1>Bi-Weekly vs. Lump Sum: What's the Best Way to Make Extra Mortgage Payments?</h1>
            <div class="meta">By Adam Abrahim &bull; February 2026 &bull; 7 min read</div>

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    You've decided to pay off your mortgage early. Smart move. But now you face a choice: should you sign up for bi-weekly payments, make a lump sum payment at the start of the year, or just add extra to your monthly check?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The answer depends on how mortgage interest actually works. Most people get this wrong, and it costs them real money.
                </p>

                <h2>How Mortgage Interest Is Actually Calculated</h2>
                <p>
                    On most conventional mortgages, your lender calculates interest <strong>monthly</strong> based on your outstanding principal balance. The formula is simple:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Monthly interest = (Annual rate / 12) &times; Outstanding principal</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the key to everything. The lower your balance when interest is calculated, the less you pay. Every dollar you remove from the principal before that calculation date saves you money. The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/how-does-paying-down-a-mortgage-work-en-1943/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> explains how each payment is split between principal and interest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This means <strong>timing matters</strong>. A dollar applied to your principal in January saves you more interest over the year than the same dollar applied in July. It's not a huge difference on a single dollar, but across thousands of dollars and decades of payments, it adds up.
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>The golden rule:</strong> The sooner you reduce your principal, the less total interest you pay. Every month your balance is lower, you save on that month's interest charge.
                </div>

                <h2>Strategy 1: Bi-Weekly Payments</h2>
                <p>
                    Bi-weekly means you pay half your monthly mortgage payment every two weeks. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, that's 26 half payments, or <strong>13 full payments instead of 12</strong>. You effectively make one extra payment per year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sounds great. Here's the catch most people miss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Most mortgage servicers do not process bi-weekly payments as they arrive.</strong> According to <a href="https://www.freddiemac.com/blog/homeownership/20200219-pay-off-your-mortgage-faster" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Freddie Mac</a>, your servicer typically holds each half payment in a suspense account until the second half arrives. Only then do they apply the full payment to your loan. This means your principal balance isn't actually dropping every two weeks. It drops once a month, just like a normal payment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The extra payment that accumulates over the year? It doesn't get applied to your principal until enough has built up. Some servicers apply it mid-year, some at the end. Either way, you're not getting the full benefit of early principal reduction.
                </p>

                <h3>Pros</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="pro">&#10003;</span> Automatic and easy to set up, aligns with biweekly paychecks</li>
                    <li><span class="pro">&#10003;</span> You get one extra payment per year without thinking about it</li>
                    <li><span class="pro">&#10003;</span> Can shave 4 to 6 years off a 30 year mortgage</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cons</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="con">&#10007;</span> Servicer holds half payments, so principal doesn't drop biweekly</li>

                <h2>Strategy 2: Lump Sum Payment at the Start of the Year</h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of spreading your extra payment across 26 installments, you make one full extra payment on January 1st (or as early in the year as possible). You specify that it goes entirely toward principal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why is this more effective? Because your principal balance drops immediately. Every single monthly interest calculation for the rest of that year is based on a lower balance. The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-a-prepayment-penalty-en-1957/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFPB confirms</a> that most modern mortgages allow prepayment without penalty, so there's no downside.
                </p>

                <div class="example-box">
                    <h3>Example: $300,000 mortgage at 7%, 30 year term</h3>
                    <p>
                        Monthly payment: approximately $1,996<br><br>
                        <strong>Bi-weekly (through servicer):</strong> Your extra payment equivalent (~$1,996) gets applied gradually over the year. You save roughly $108,000 in interest and pay off about 5.5 years early.<br><br>
                        <strong>Lump sum on Jan 1st each year:</strong> That same $1,996 hits your principal immediately. You save roughly $117,000 in interest and pay off about 6 years early.<br><br>
                        <strong>The difference: around $9,000 in additional savings</strong>, just by changing when the money is applied. Same amount of money out of your pocket.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Pros</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="pro">&#10003;</span> Maximum interest savings because principal drops immediately</li>
                    <li><span class="pro">&#10003;</span> You control exactly when and how the money is applied</li>
                    <li><span class="pro">&#10003;</span> No servicer fees</li>
                    <li><span class="pro">&#10003;</span> Works well with annual bonuses, tax refunds, or planned savings</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cons</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="con">&#10007;</span> Requires discipline to save up one full payment</li>
                    <li><span class="con">&#10007;</span> Not automatic; you have to remember to do it</li>
                    <li><span class="con">&#10007;</span> Money is locked up in a lump sum instead of spread out</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Strategy 3: Extra Added to Each Monthly Payment</h2>
                <p>
                    The third option is simply adding extra to every monthly payment. If your payment is $1,996, you pay $2,163 instead (that's $1,996 / 12 = $167 extra per month, which equals one extra payment over the year).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach falls between the other two in terms of interest savings. Each month, a little more principal gets knocked off. You don't get the full front-loaded benefit of a January lump sum, but you also don't have the servicer holding your money like with bi-weekly.
                </p>

                <h3>Pros</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="pro">&#10003;</span> Easy to budget, same amount every month</li>
                    <li><span class="pro">&#10003;</span> Principal drops a little faster every single month</li>
                    <li><span class="pro">&#10003;</span> No fees, no special setup required</li>
                    <li><span class="pro">&#10003;</span> Flexible; you can adjust the amount anytime</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="con">&#10007;</span> Slightly less effective than a lump sum approach</li>
                    <li><span class="con">&#10007;</span> Requires you to manually specify "apply to principal" each time (with some servicers)</li>

                <h2>What About "True" Bi-Weekly Processing?</h2>
                <p>
                    Some lenders and third-party services do offer true bi-weekly processing, where they actually apply your half payment to the principal every two weeks. This is different from what most servicers do. If your lender offers this (ask them directly), the savings would be closer to the lump sum approach because your principal truly drops every 14 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, be cautious with third-party bi-weekly services. The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFPB has warned consumers</a> about companies that charge hundreds of dollars to set up bi-weekly payment plans you could do yourself for free.
                </p>

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                <p>
                    Paying off your mortgage early is a game of reducing your principal as fast as possible. The sooner a dollar comes off your balance, the more interest it saves you over the life of the loan.
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Our recommendation:</strong> If you have the discipline to save up one extra payment, make it as a lump sum at the beginning of the year. If you'd rather not think about it, set up automatic monthly payments with extra going to principal. Bi-weekly through a servicer is better than nothing, but it's the least efficient of the three options.
                </div>

                <p>
                    The best strategy is whichever one you'll actually stick with. Any extra payment beats no extra payment. But if you're optimizing for maximum savings, the math is clear: front-load your extra payments whenever possible.
                </p>

                    <h4>Written by Adam Abrahim</h4>
                    <p>I bought my first home at 25, back when that was still a normal thing to do. Today, the median age of a first-time homebuyer has reached 40. Over the past 20 years working in the mortgage industry, I've watched the path to homeownership get harder for millions of Americans. Home prices have doubled, rates have swung wildly, and the financial literacy gap has only grown wider. I follow the markets, treasury yields, housing data, Fed policy, not because it's my job, but because I genuinely believe understanding these forces is the difference between feeling stuck and finding a way forward. I built this site to provide powerful tools, helpful mortgage insights, and share what I've learned over two decades to help everyday people like me make confident, informed decisions about the biggest purchase of their lives.</p>
